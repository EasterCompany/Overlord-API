# What is Overlord?

Overlord is a true full stack framework which allows a developer to create a front end application for Web, iOS and
Android in a single unified code base, build a back end API for that application, configure a deployment pipeline with
CI/CD and manage their server's networking protocols all from a single repository.

## Pop-up Infrastructure

Our framework automates everything you might need to do when starting a new project, meaning you can get started on the
bits that matter as soon as possible.

This includes (but not limited to):

- User friendly command line interface.
- Universal Platform React App, deployable to Web, iOS & Android.
- Universal Python API, ready to route your functions.
- User authentication, permissions & sessions.
- Nginx gateway with support for multiple servers on a single machine.
- SQLite3 or Postgresql database.
- Redis in-memory caching system which seamlessly integrates into your main database.
- Highly performant SEO improvement features.

## Popular Support

Overlord is based on the most popular developer ecosystems available such as React, Django, Redis & Nginx, meaning you
will never struggle to find support for your problems, or libraries for your code.

## Go CLI

The Overlord-CLI is written in GO, which allows us to run complex development operations in a highly optimized fashion
and without ever slowing you down when you just need to get going.

## Python APIs

Your backend APIs will be running Python (Cython), for incredible development speed and far better performance when
compared to JavaScript backend alternatives. Out of the box your server on the most basic hardware available should
support up to 3 million simultaneous requests.

## TypeScript Applications

All frontend clients are setup to use typescript by default in a low-enforcement configuration so you can use the
benefits of typescript in every application, but without it getting in your way when you just need to move fast!
